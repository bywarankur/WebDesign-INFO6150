                Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest we take between two deep breaths.
                True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life. 
                Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. 
                Yoga doesnâ€™t care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming. 
                Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, 
                its essence must be embodied.

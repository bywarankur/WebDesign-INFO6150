                <h2>Room Security</h2>
                <p>Guests need to feel safe and welcome at your establishment. Consider how you can improve hotel rooms to increase security. A straightforward update is an in-room safe. It's easy to come up with relevant items to stash inside, especially when traveling. Guests can stow essential documents, passports, collectible coins, souvenir gifts and more.

                    Beyond a safe, consider upgrading all room locks, including on the doors and windows. Most guests prefer an in-room lock that can't open from the outside. This security measure allows guests to feel safe inside, especially when they tuck themselves into bed for a good night's sleep.!</p>
